* lein-plz

  A Leiningen plugin for quickly adding dependencies to projects. Only
  supports =lein 2.4.0= and greater.

** Usage

   Suppose you want to add =clojurescript=, =core.async= and
   =data.json= to a project. Maybe you remember the versions latest
   versions off-hand (or at least, a valid one so that you can use
   lein ancient). You still have to type out all the group id stuff --
   anyway, it takes some typing.

   With =lein-plz=, it's just

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     lein plz add async cljs json
   #+END_SRC

   and your =project.clj= is updated.

   Finally, you can add abbreviations.
*** TODO Add abbreviation details

** Installation

   For now - as it has not yet been released - clone the repository,
   enter it and run =lein install=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     git clone https://github.com/johnwalker/lein-plz
     cd lein-plz & lein install
   #+END_SRC

   Finally, add =[lein-plz "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]= to the `:plugins` vector
   of your `:user` profile.
